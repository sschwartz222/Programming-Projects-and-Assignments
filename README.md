# Programming-Projects-and-Assignments
A collection of various projects and homework assignments over a few years

cs151 consists of Typed Racket code, cs152 and cs154 of C code, cs223 of Elm code, and cs209 of Java code.

Some notable projects to check out:
     
     1. A fully playable version of the board game Othello created using Typed Racket, complete with an AI. 
        Find the project under cs151/proj2. To play a round against a relatively competent AI using a 
        minimax strategy, use (run 8 'black ((minimax-strategy (prefer-corners-and-edges 5 2)) 2))
        
     2. An interactive synth playable in your browser, created with Elm. 
        Find the project under cs223/project/final_product.
     
     3. A typing game designed for elementary-school-aged visually-impaired students 
        created using Java in collaboration with Adam Rivkin (amrivkin). 
        Find the project under cs209/CfL_Lab1/src/edu/virginia/lab1test/FinalGame.java, 
        and the full game design document under cs209/CfL_Lab1/design. 
        The game is a "minimum viable product" implementation of the ideas laid out in the game design document, 
        with three levels (the tutorial and two levels from the middle of the game). 
        The game engine used was coded by us, the construction of which can be seen by "LabXGame.java" etc. 
        Music from the game is original!
